The app will provide a user-friendly interface for creating and customizing slides with minimal effort, similar to Canva’s intuitive design. Initially, the app will feature basic functionality, such as selecting a template, entering a title or prompt, and automatically generating slides with relevant content. Users can customize the slide layout, font styles, and background colors, while keeping the design process simple and accessible for beginners.

This app will help users create professional-looking presentations in minutes while offering an easy entry point for learning iOS development.
